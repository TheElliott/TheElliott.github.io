            <p>Born in San Diego, California, Elliott Brown first discovered his passion for games at a young age. Taking after his family of gamers, he was exposed to video games very early on in his life. While playing Fat Princess, his dad showed him his name in the credits. After that, he was obsessed with the idea of being in the credits of a game and even making his own. He fell in love with the creation of video games, spending most of his life playing and appreciating them.</p>
